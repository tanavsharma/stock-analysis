# stock-analysis
## Overview

In this repo, we will be able to analyzie an entire dataset of stocks at the click of a button. We will then make the code more efficient so it decreases the time it takes for execution and also improve performance. We will also be comparing the datasets from 2017 and 2018 and visualize the differences and similarities. 

## Results and Findings

### Benefits of Refactoring

Before we dive into the analysis of the data, lets look at the differnece between our code improvements. Below you will find two images of the time it took to execute the result. This output is the result of the initial code written.

</p>

However, after looking into the code and modifying the logic, we were able to: 
- produce the same output but with less steps
- use signficantly less memory

and as a result we were able to run our code/script much faster as shown by the images below
